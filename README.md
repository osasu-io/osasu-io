# 💫 About Me:
👋🏾 Hey there, I’m Osasu<br>

I’m a technologist building secure, measurable digital systems at the intersection of web engineering, marketing technology, SEO, AI, and cybersecurity. My journey started with art and design, evolved through web development and digital marketing, and is now expanding into automation architecture and security focused systems thinking.<br><br>

I’m especially interested in how data flows through websites, APIs, analytics platforms, and automation tools, and how those systems can be structured to be scalable, observable, and secure. Whether it is search optimized content architecture, a webhook driven automation pipeline, or a validation layer protecting data integrity, I approach technology as interconnected systems rather than isolated tools.<br><br>
